# Automation Framework

üöÄ Automation Framework for seamless testing of web and desktop applications, 
designed to provide scalability, reliability, and ease of use. 
Built with C#, NUnit, and Selenium WebDriver, this framework supports parallel test execution, 
JSON-based test data management, and dynamic browser configuration.



# Overview

This project is a highly extensible automation framework designed for:

* Web application testing.
* Desktop application testing.
* Streamlined test data management using JSON.
* Dynamic browser configuration for multi-browser testing.



# Features 

‚úîÔ∏è Supports cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

‚úîÔ∏è Parallel test execution for faster feedback.

‚úîÔ∏è JSON-based test data integration for flexibility.

‚úîÔ∏è Modular and reusable page object model (POM).

‚úîÔ∏è Easy integration with CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions.

‚úîÔ∏è Logging and reporting for better test insights.



# Technologies Used

- C#
- NUnit
- Selenium WebDriver
- JSON.NET (for test data management)
- GitHub Actions (for CI/CD)



# Parallel Execution

This framework supports parallel test execution for improved efficiency. 
Tests are distributed across multiple threads or browsers dynamically.

To enable parallelism, ensure the following:

- Use the [Parallelizable] attribute in your test classes.
- Configure the ParallelScope appropriately.
